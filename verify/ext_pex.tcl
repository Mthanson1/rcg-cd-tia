# Magic: PARASITIC (RC) extraction of the TIA top cell.
# Run:  magic -dnull -noconsole -rcfile env/.magicrc verify/ext_pex.tcl
# Produces: verify/tia_pex.spice  (with parasitic caps, for post-layout sim)
#
# Unlike ext_lvs.tcl (which calls `ext2spice lvs` and strips all parasitics),
# this pass keeps parasitic capacitance.  cthresh 0 = include EVERY parasitic
# cap (coupling + substrate); rthresh 0 would add wire R but is left at the lvs
# default here -- cap-only PEX is the standard first pass and captures the
# dominant effect (node caps loading the high-impedance internal nodes).
